# Scheduler Service
---
This is a service that receives input from various sources and generates data that is sent to various notification services.

## Dependencies
To get started you need the [docker toolbox][1] installed. This guarantees that you have `docker` and `docker-compose` commands available for use.

## Get started

Browser to your project directory via the terminal or command line and run the commands below:

1. `docker-compose build`
2. `docker-compose run`

This will create a running dockerised environment with settings pulled from the docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile in the project directory. You also get live reload feature enabled so the server automatically refreshes whenever you make changes ;-)
